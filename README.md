# Reinforcement-Learning-FA24-Final-Project
Repo for final project materials for Reinforcement Learning Fall 2024

This repository contains code and resources for the project "Reinforcement Learning in Neuromechanical Simulation of Human Locomotion". The goal of this project was to use reinforcement learning algorithms to modulate neuromuscular control parameters for achieving dynamic gait behaviors in a simulated environment.

Repository Contents
Model Files: Musculoskeletal models used
Neuromuscular Control File: Implements the reflex-based control used in the MyoSuite simulation environment.
RL-Control Interface: Facilitates the relationship between reinforcement learning policies and the neuromuscular control model.
Processing Script: Post-processing tools for analyzing kinematics, rewards, and other simulation metrics.
Results: PPO and A2C outcomes from both Slow-down and Speed-up conditions, including videos and reference plots.

Note:
A large portion of the necessary dependencies, including the CMA-ES optimization scripts and neuromechanical model control scripts, are exclusive to the NeuMove Laboratory and are not included in this repository. As a result, this codebase cannot be fully executed without access to those components. If you have further questions, you can reach me at robbins.cal@northeastern.edu
